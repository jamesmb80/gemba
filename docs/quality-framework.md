# Quality Framework for AI Development Workflow
## Phase 1.3: Quality Gates and Review Standards

Based on the "lowest value stage" principle from Intel's "High Output Management" - catch problems early before they compound into expensive fixes.

## Core Philosophy: Lowest Value Stage Review

> "Fix any problem at the lowest value stage" - Intel CEO

**Applied to AI Development:**
- **Idea Stage**: Validate direction before research
- **Research Stage**: Review plans before implementation  
- **Implementation Stage**: Code review before deployment
- **Testing Stage**: Catch bugs before production

## 1. Human Review Gates

### Gate 1: Idea Validation (30 seconds)
**When**: Before triggering AI research
**Questions**:
- [ ] Does this align with GembaFix product vision?
- [ ] Is this the right priority now?
- [ ] Do we have enough context for good research?

**Actions**: Approve, clarify, or defer

### Gate 2: Research Plan Review (5-10 minutes)
**When**: After AI creates detailed GitHub issue
**Review Checklist**:

#### Direction & Vision
- [ ] **Correct Problem**: Is this solving the right user problem?
- [ ] **Clear Vision**: Is the solution approach sound?
- [ ] **Scope Appropriate**: Right size for current capacity?
- [ ] **Aligns with Architecture**: Fits existing patterns?

#### Technical Quality
- [ ] **Requirements Complete**: All technical needs identified?
- [ ] **Implementation Feasible**: Realistic approach and timeline?
- [ ] **Dependencies Clear**: External requirements identified?
- [ ] **Risks Assessed**: Potential issues and mitigation?

#### Planning Quality
- [ ] **Steps Actionable**: Can a developer follow this?
- [ ] **Testing Strategy**: How will we verify success?
- [ ] **Success Criteria**: Clear definition of done?
- [ ] **Resource Estimate**: Realistic time and effort?

**Red Flags**:
- Vague requirements or success criteria
- Missing consideration of existing codebase
- No testing or validation strategy
- Unrealistic timelines or complexity
- Poor understanding of user needs

### Gate 3: Implementation Review (10-15 minutes)
**When**: After AI generates code changes
**Code Review Standards**:

#### GembaFix Code Quality
- [ ] **TypeScript**: Proper types, no `any` usage
- [ ] **React Patterns**: Follows existing component structure
- [ ] **Supabase Integration**: Correct authentication and RLS
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Graceful failure and user feedback
- [ ] **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation
- [ ] **Performance**: Efficient queries and rendering
- [ ] **Testing**: Unit tests for critical logic

#### Manufacturing Domain
- [ ] **Manufacturing Context**: Understands industrial environment
- [ ] **Technician Workflow**: Supports hands-free operation
- [ ] **Voice Compatibility**: Works with voice input/output
- [ ] **Reliability**: Handles network issues gracefully

## 2. Automated Quality Gates

### Pre-Implementation Checks
```bash
# Run before starting implementation
npm run type-check    # TypeScript validation
npm run lint          # Code style and quality
npm run test          # Unit tests pass
```

### Pre-Merge Checks
```bash
# Run before merging to main
npm run build         # Production build succeeds
npm run test:e2e      # End-to-end tests pass
npm run test:a11y     # Accessibility tests pass
```

### AI Prompt Quality (Evals)
- **Consistency Check**: Run prompt 10 times, check pass rate
- **Output Quality**: Verify GitHub issue completeness
- **Research Depth**: Ensure adequate codebase analysis
- **Best Practice**: Check for industry standard recommendations

## 3. Review Process Workflows

### Research Review Process
1. **AI generates detailed GitHub issue**
2. **Human reviews using checklist above**
3. **If approved**: Move to "Ready" status
4. **If needs work**: Add review comments and regenerate
5. **If rejected**: Close and document learnings

### Implementation Review Process
1. **AI creates pull request**
2. **Automated checks run** (tests, lints, builds)
3. **Human code review** using standards above
4. **If approved**: Merge to main
5. **If needs work**: Request changes and re-run AI
6. **If rejected**: Close and document learnings

## 4. Quality Metrics & Improvement

### Track These Metrics
- **Human Approval Rate**: % of AI plans approved on first review
- **Rework Rate**: % of implementations requiring changes
- **Bug Escape Rate**: Issues found in production vs development
- **Cycle Time**: Idea to production timeline
- **Developer Satisfaction**: Ease of working with AI-generated code

### Improvement Triggers
- **<80% approval rate**: Improve research prompts
- **>20% rework rate**: Better implementation prompts
- **>5% bug escape**: Strengthen testing requirements
- **Slow cycle time**: Streamline review process

## 5. Common AI-Generated Issues & Solutions

### Typical Problems in AI Plans
1. **Generic Solutions**: Not specific to manufacturing domain
   - **Fix**: Add manufacturing context to prompts
   
2. **Missing Edge Cases**: Doesn't consider error scenarios
   - **Fix**: Require error handling in all plans
   
3. **Poor Integration**: Ignores existing patterns
   - **Fix**: Emphasize codebase analysis in research

4. **Scope Creep**: Plans too ambitious for timeframe
   - **Fix**: Set clear constraints in prompts

### Typical Problems in AI Code
1. **Type Safety**: Uses `any` or missing types
   - **Fix**: Strengthen TypeScript requirements
   
2. **Poor Error Handling**: Crashes on edge cases
   - **Fix**: Require try-catch and user feedback
   
3. **Accessibility Issues**: Missing ARIA labels
   - **Fix**: Include accessibility in code review

4. **Performance Problems**: Inefficient queries or rendering
   - **Fix**: Performance requirements in prompts

## 6. Making Reviews Efficient

### Speed Up Research Reviews
- **Use Templates**: Standard review questions
- **Focus on Direction**: Is this the right approach?
- **Ask Questions**: "What would a good PM ask about this?"
- **Request Examples**: Concrete user scenarios

### Speed Up Code Reviews
- **Automated First**: Let tools catch syntax and style
- **Focus on Logic**: Business rules and user experience
- **Check Integration**: How does it fit existing code?
- **Verify Testing**: Are critical paths covered?

## 7. Emergency Procedures

### When AI Goes Wrong
1. **Stop Immediately**: Don't let broken workflows continue
2. **Assess Damage**: What needs to be reverted or fixed?
3. **Root Cause**: Why did the AI make this mistake?
4. **Improve Prompts**: Update to prevent recurrence
5. **Document Learning**: Share with team

### Quality Recovery
- **Immediate**: Fix the specific issue
- **Short-term**: Improve prompts to prevent similar issues
- **Long-term**: Strengthen quality gates and reviews

This framework ensures we catch problems early while maintaining the speed benefits of AI-assisted development.
