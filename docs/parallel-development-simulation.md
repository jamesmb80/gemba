# Parallel Development Simulation
## Phase 3.2: Testing Multiple Feature Research Simultaneously

**Goal**: Demonstrate the Kora team's parallel development approach with real GembaFix features
**Method**: Simulate running multiple Claude Code instances with different features

## üöÄ Parallel Execution Simulation

Since we can't literally run multiple Claude Code instances in this session, I'll simulate what would happen by showing the complete workflow for 5 features being researched simultaneously.

### Selected Features for Parallel Research

Based on our jamming session plan, here are 5 features I'll simulate researching in parallel:

1. **Checklist System** - "Add checklist system for multi-step troubleshooting procedures"
2. **Smart Manual Search** - "Create smart manual search that understands equipment variations"  
3. **Knowledge Sharing** - "Add knowledge sharing system for repair insights and tips"
4. **Safety Integration** - "Add mandatory safety checklist integration to troubleshooting flows"
5. **Bookmarking System** - "Add bookmarking system for quick access to important manual content"
