## Step 4: GitHub Issue Creation ✅

### Manual Process (Until GitHub CLI Setup)
1. ✅ Copy generated issue content from research output
2. ✅ Navigate to GitHub repository: https://github.com/jamesmb80/GEMBA
3. ✅ Create new issue using Feature template
4. ✅ Paste comprehensive content (2000+ words)
5. ✅ Add appropriate labels: ~feature ~manufacturing ~voice ~accessibility ~feedback
6. ✅ Assign to project board: "Backlog" → "Ready" (after approval)
7. ✅ Set priority and milestone

### Automated Process (Future with GitHub CLI)
```bash
# Would be automated with custom command
gh issue create --title "Feature: Quick Feedback Rating for AI Chat Responses" \
  --body-file workflow-test-1-chat-feedback.md \
  --label feature,manufacturing,voice,accessibility,feedback \
  --project "GembaFix AI Development Workflow" \
  --milestone "Sprint 3"
```

---

## Step 5: Project Board Management ✅

### Issue Movement Through Workflow
1. **Backlog**: Feature idea captured
2. **Research**: AI research in progress (10 min)
3. **Ready**: Human review approved, ready for implementation
4. **In Progress**: Developer working on implementation
5. **Review**: Code review and testing
6. **Done**: Merged and deployed

### Current Status: Ready for Implementation ✅
- Research completed and approved
- Issue created with comprehensive specification  
- Developer can start implementation immediately
- Clear acceptance criteria and testing requirements

---

## Step 6: Implementation Handoff ✅
