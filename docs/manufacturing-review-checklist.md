## üë• USER EXPERIENCE (1 minute)

### Accessibility & Adoption ‚úÖ
- [ ] **Screen Reader Ready**: Proper ARIA labels and navigation
- [ ] **Color Blind Safe**: Info not conveyed by color alone
- [ ] **Intuitive Design**: Obvious without training
- [ ] **Error Prevention**: Hard to make mistakes
- [ ] **Clear Value**: Benefit immediately apparent

**Quick Questions**:
- Can technicians with disabilities use this effectively?
- Will people actually want to use this feature?
- Is it obviously better than the current approach?

## üìä BUSINESS VALUE (1 minute)

### Manufacturing Impact ‚úÖ
- [ ] **Downtime Reduction**: Helps resolve issues faster
- [ ] **Preventive Focus**: Enables proactive maintenance
- [ ] **Knowledge Capture**: Preserves and shares expertise
- [ ] **Safety Enhancement**: Improves workplace safety
- [ ] **Efficiency Gain**: Streamlines existing processes

**Quick Questions**:
- Does this solve a real production problem?
- Will this reduce downtime or improve safety?
- Is the benefit worth the implementation effort?

### Implementation Reality ‚úÖ
- [ ] **Timeline Realistic**: Time estimates fit current capacity
- [ ] **Dependencies Clear**: Prerequisites identified and available
- [ ] **Risk Managed**: Technical challenges have mitigation plans
- [ ] **Deployment Viable**: Can roll out safely to production

**Quick Questions**:
- Can we actually build this in the estimated time?
- Do we have everything we need to get started?
- What could go wrong and how do we handle it?

## üö® DECISION MATRIX

### ‚úÖ APPROVE (Target: 80%+)
**All sections mostly ‚úÖ with clear manufacturing value**
- Move to "Ready" status
- Assign to developer 
- Proceed with implementation

### üîÑ REFINE (Target: 15%)
**Good direction but gaps in key areas**
- Request specific improvements
- Common requests:
  - "Add more detail on voice implementation"
  - "Consider offline scenarios better"
  - "Break down complex phases"
  - "Add more accessibility details"

### ‚ùå REJECT (Target: <5%)
**Poor fit or unrealistic scope**
- Close and document learnings
- Common reasons:
  - Doesn't address real manufacturing problems
  - Technical approach fundamentally flawed
  - Scope too large for current capacity

## üéØ REVIEW BEST PRACTICES

### Before You Start
- [ ] Read feature title and problem statement first
- [ ] Scan implementation phases for scope understanding
- [ ] Note estimated timeline and complexity

### During Review
- [ ] Focus on direction and fit, not implementation details
- [ ] Ask "Would a technician actually use this?"
- [ ] Check if AI understood manufacturing environment
- [ ] Verify integration with existing GembaFix features

### After Review
- [ ] Document decision clearly with reasoning
- [ ] If REFINE: Be specific about what needs improvement
- [ ] If APPROVE: Move to appropriate project board lane
- [ ] Track review time for process improvement

### Speed Tips
- **Don't read everything**: Focus on problem, approach, and key requirements
- **Trust the AI**: For technical details, validate approach not implementation
- **Manufacturing first**: Start with "does this solve a real factory problem?"
- **Use examples**: "Like when a technician is troubleshooting pump failure..."

This checklist enables consistent 5-7 minute reviews that catch problems early while maintaining the speed benefits of AI-assisted development.
