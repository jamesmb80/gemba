## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
Story 1.1 (Vector Database Infrastructure Setup) has been completed successfully, providing:
- pgvector extension installed and configured
- Embeddings table with proper vector columns and indexes
- RLS policies for multi-tenant isolation
- Connection pooling configured for vector operations
- Feature flag system (VECTOR_SEARCH_ENABLED) established

The chunking pipeline will store chunks in the `document_chunks` table created in Story 1.1, with relationships to the `embeddings` table for vector storage.

[Source: docs/stories/1.1.story.md]

### Current System Context
The GembaFix application currently has a simple PDF viewer located at `src/app/dashboard/machine/[id]/manual/page.tsx`. This component is identified as "COMPLEX" and needs to be replaced with intelligent document processing capabilities.

Current PDF processing:
- **File Storage**: Supabase Storage (already in use for PDF manuals)
- **Viewer Component**: Located at `src/app/dashboard/machine/[id]/manual/page.tsx`
- **Status**: Has multiple failed fix attempts documented (high-priority technical debt)

[Source: docs/brownfield-architecture.md#Enhancement Impact Areas]

### Technical Stack Integration
The document chunking pipeline will integrate with:
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL 15+) with pgvector extension from Story 1.1
- **File Storage**: Supabase Storage (existing PDF storage)
- **Processing**: Supabase Edge Functions for scalable document processing
- **API**: Next.js API routes under `/api/chunking/`

[Source: docs/brownfield-architecture.md#Technical Summary]

### File Locations
Based on the project structure, new chunking code should be placed in:
- **API Routes**: `src/app/api/chunking/` (new directory for chunking endpoints)
- **Edge Functions**: `supabase/functions/document-chunking/` (for scalable processing)
- **Types**: `src/lib/types/chunking.ts` (new file for chunk-related types)
- **Utilities**: `src/lib/chunking/` (new directory for chunking logic)
- **Components**: `src/components/chunking/` (new directory for chunking UI components)

[Source: docs/brownfield-architecture.md#Project Structure]

### Database Schema Integration
The chunking pipeline will utilize the database schema created in Story 1.1:
- **document_chunks table**: For storing chunk content and metadata
- **embeddings table**: For storing vector embeddings of chunks
- **RLS policies**: For multi-tenant isolation
- **Foreign key relationships**: Between chunks and embeddings

[Source: docs/stories/1.1.story.md#Database Configuration]

### Performance Considerations
From the technical assessment, the system must maintain:
- **Current Performance**: API response times average 200-500ms (don't degrade)
- **Initial Load**: Currently ~3.5s (don't increase)
- **Scalability**: Must handle large manufacturing manuals (500+ pages)

Critical performance requirements:
- Chunking process must complete within 5 minutes for 500-page manual
- No impact on existing PDF viewer performance
- Progress tracking must not block document processing

[Source: docs/bmad-technical-assessment.md#Performance Analysis]

### Security Considerations
Multi-tenant security requirements:
- **RLS Policies**: All chunks must be isolated by tenant_id
- **Access Control**: Only authorized users can trigger chunking
- **Data Isolation**: Chunks must be separated between organizations

[Source: docs/prd.md#Story 1.2 Integration Verification]

### Technical Debt Context
The PDF viewer has accumulated significant technical debt:
- **Critical Issues**: Multiple failed fix attempts documented
- **Priority**: High-priority technical debt (2-3 days estimated effort)
- **Impact**: Affects core functionality of the application

The chunking pipeline provides an opportunity to resolve these issues while adding new capabilities.

[Source: docs/bmad-technical-assessment.md#Technical Debt Inventory]

### Integration with Existing Components
The chunking pipeline must integrate with:
- **Manual Viewer**: Current component at `src/app/dashboard/machine/[id]/manual/page.tsx`
- **File Upload**: Existing PDF upload process in Supabase Storage
- **Machine Records**: Link chunks to specific machines and manual sections

[Source: docs/brownfield-architecture.md#Enhancement Impact Areas]

### Rollback Strategy
Based on the PRD requirements, the chunking pipeline must include:
- **Feature Flag**: CHUNKING_ENABLED defaulting to false
- **Rollback Triggers**: PDF upload failures >5%, chunking timeouts, viewer breaks
- **Rollback Steps**: Disable feature flag, stop background jobs, revert to original flow
- **Data Protection**: Preserve existing PDF viewer functionality during rollback

[Source: docs/prd.md#Story 1.2 Rollback Procedures]

## Testing
- Unit tests for chunking algorithm with various document types
- Integration tests with Supabase Storage and Edge Functions
- Performance tests for large document processing (500+ pages)
- Security tests for multi-tenant chunk isolation
- Rollback procedure tests with various failure scenarios
- UI tests for progress tracking and user feedback
