## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
This is the first story in the epic, so no previous story context is available.

### Current System Context
The GembaFix application currently uses Supabase (PostgreSQL 15+) as its database. The system is built on Next.js 14+ with TypeScript 5.x and uses Supabase for authentication, database, and file storage.

[Source: docs/brownfield-architecture.md#Technical Summary]

### Database Configuration
- **Current Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL 15+)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with RLS as core security requirement
- **File Storage**: Supabase Storage (currently used for PDF manuals)
- **Required Extension**: pgvector for vector operations

[Source: docs/brownfield-architecture.md#Actual Tech Stack]

### Supabase Client Configuration
The existing Supabase client is located at `frontend/src/lib/supabaseClient.ts` and uses environment variables:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

The client includes both browser and server-side client creation functions.

[Source: frontend/src/lib/supabaseClient.ts]

### File Locations
Based on the project structure, new database-related code should be placed in:
- **Migrations**: `supabase/migrations/` (create new migration files here)
- **Types**: Create new file `frontend/src/lib/types/vector.ts` for vector-related types
- **Database Utilities**: Create new file `frontend/src/lib/db/vector.ts` for vector operations
- **Configuration**: Update existing `frontend/src/lib/supabaseClient.ts` if needed

[Source: docs/brownfield-architecture.md#Project Structure]

### Security Considerations
- RLS (Row Level Security) is a core requirement for the system
- Multi-tenant isolation must be enforced at the database level
- All new tables must have appropriate RLS policies

[Source: docs/brownfield-architecture.md#Actual Tech Stack]

### Performance Considerations
From the technical assessment:
- Missing indexes on frequently queried fields (address this for vector tables)
- Current initial load time is ~3.5s (don't degrade this)
- API response times average 200-500ms (maintain this for vector queries)

[Source: docs/bmad-technical-assessment.md#Performance Analysis]

### Testing Requirements
While specific testing standards weren't found in the architecture docs, the project uses:
- Jest for unit tests
- Testing should follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Create tests in `__tests__` directories adjacent to the code being tested
- Integration tests should verify database operations

### Technical Constraints
- Must maintain compatibility with existing database operations
- Cannot break existing RLS policies
- Must support rollback without data loss
- Feature flag system required for gradual rollout

## Testing
- Unit tests for all utility functions
- Integration tests for database operations
- Performance tests for vector operations
- Security tests for RLS policies
- Load tests for connection pooling
- Rollback procedure tests
