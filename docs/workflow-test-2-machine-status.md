# Workflow Test 2: Machine Status Dashboard
## Testing Master Research Prompt with Complex Feature

**Feature Idea**: "Add real-time machine status indicators to the dashboard for monitoring equipment health"

---

# Feature: Real-Time Machine Status Monitoring Dashboard

## üè≠ Manufacturing Context
**User Persona**: Manufacturing technicians and maintenance supervisors monitoring multiple machines
**Use Case**: Quick visual assessment of equipment health across facility to prioritize troubleshooting and maintenance
**Environment**: Industrial setting requiring at-a-glance status monitoring, potentially viewed from distance
**Workflow Integration**: Central hub accessed between troubleshooting sessions and during facility rounds

## üìã Problem Statement
**Current State**: Machine information exists in database but no real-time visual status monitoring
**Pain Points**: 
- No immediate visibility into equipment health across facility
- Reactive troubleshooting only when machines fail
- Missing early warning system for potential issues
- No centralized monitoring for maintenance planning

**Impact**: Equipment failures surprise technicians, leading to costly downtime and emergency repairs instead of preventive maintenance
**Success Vision**: Technicians can instantly assess facility-wide equipment health, enabling proactive maintenance and faster response to emerging issues

## üéØ Solution Approach
**High-Level Strategy**: Create visual dashboard with color-coded machine status indicators, real-time updates, and drill-down capabilities
**Key Components**: 
- Dashboard grid showing all machines with status colors
- Real-time data pipeline from machine sensors/systems
- Status calculation engine based on multiple health metrics
- Alert system for critical status changes

**Integration Points**: 
- Existing machine data in Supabase database
- Potential integration with facility monitoring systems
- Machine detail pages for drill-down information
- Alert notifications through existing chat system

**User Experience Flow**:
1. Technician accesses dashboard from main navigation
2. Grid view shows all machines with color-coded status indicators
3. Green (healthy), yellow (attention needed), red (critical), gray (offline)
4. Click/tap machine for detailed status and troubleshooting options
5. Real-time updates without page refresh
6. Optional: Push notifications for critical status changes

  - Mitigation: Implement robust offline handling, cached status display, multiple data sources
- **Performance at scale**: Dashboard may become slow with hundreds of machines
  - Mitigation: Implement pagination, virtualization, efficient data structures

### Medium Risk  
- **Status calculation accuracy**: Complex algorithms for determining machine health
  - Mitigation: Start with simple heartbeat-based status, iterate based on domain expert input
- **External system integration**: Dependency on facility monitoring APIs/webhooks
  - Mitigation: Design flexible integration layer, provide manual status override capability

### Low Risk
- **Color accessibility**: Color-only status indication may not work for color-blind users
