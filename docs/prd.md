#### Enhancement Description
Transform GembaFix from an internal troubleshooting tool with basic PDF reading into a production-ready SaaS platform with advanced AI manual comprehension. The core improvement focuses on implementing vector embeddings and intelligent document chunking to dramatically improve how AI understands technical manuals and their relationship to specific machines.

#### Impact Assessment
✓ Major Impact (architectural changes required) - This enhancement requires:
- New vector database infrastructure
- Document processing pipeline for chunking and embedding
- Multi-tenant architecture for SaaS model
- Subscription and billing systems
- Enhanced security and data isolation

### Goals and Background Context

#### Goals
- Enable AI to deeply understand manual content through intelligent vectorization and chunking
- Create contextual relationships between manual sections and specific machine types/models
- Build production-ready infrastructure supporting multiple customers
- Implement comprehensive tracking for troubleshooting history, bugs, and service calls
- Establish subscription-based revenue model for manufacturing facilities
- Improve troubleshooting accuracy through better AI comprehension of technical documentation

#### Background Context
Currently, GembaFix uses a basic approach where the AI reads PDF content directly, which limits its ability to understand context, relationships, and technical nuances. Manufacturing facilities need more intelligent assistance that truly comprehends their equipment manuals, can track issues over time, and provide insights based on historical data. 

By implementing vector embeddings and intelligent document processing, the AI can understand semantic relationships, technical concepts, and provide more accurate troubleshooting guidance. The evolution to a SaaS model opens up significant market opportunity as manufacturing facilities increasingly seek digital transformation solutions.
