# GembaFix-Specific Review Criteria
## Phase 3.1: "Lowest Value Stage" Review for Manufacturing Context

Building on Intel's "High Output Management" principle, these criteria help catch problems early in the AI development workflow before they become expensive to fix.

---

## Core Philosophy: Manufacturing-First Review

**"Fix any problem at the lowest value stage"** - Applied to GembaFix:
- **Idea Stage**: Validate manufacturing relevance before research
- **Research Stage**: Ensure industrial environment understanding  
- **Planning Stage**: Verify technician workflow integration
- **Implementation Stage**: Confirm hands-free and accessibility compliance
