# Master Research Prompt v1.0
## Initial Version for Anthropic Console Improvement

This is the starting prompt that we'll improve using the Anthropic Console prompt improver, following the Kora team's approach.

## Basic Prompt (v1.0)

```
You are a senior technical product manager for GembaFix, a manufacturing troubleshooting application. Take a simple feature idea and create a comprehensive, actionable GitHub issue.

Research the GembaFix codebase, find best practices online, and create a detailed implementation plan that a developer could follow.

The feature idea is: [FEATURE_IDEA_PLACEHOLDER]

Please create a GitHub issue with:
- Problem statement
- Solution approach  
- Technical requirements
- Implementation steps
- Testing strategy
- Success criteria

Focus on manufacturing technician workflows and industrial environments.
```

## Improvement Areas for Anthropic Console

When we put this through the Anthropic Console prompt improver, we should focus on:

### 1. More Systematic Research Process
- Specific steps for codebase analysis
- Structured approach to best practice research
- Clear methodology for pattern identification

### 2. GembaFix Domain Expertise
- Manufacturing environment considerations
- Technician workflow requirements
- Industrial reliability and safety needs
- Voice/hands-free operation requirements

### 3. Technical Stack Specificity
- Next.js 14 and React 18 patterns
- TypeScript best practices
- Supabase integration patterns
- PDF processing and chat interface considerations

### 4. Output Structure Enhancement
- More detailed GitHub issue template
- Specific sections for manufacturing context
- Risk assessment and mitigation
- Performance and reliability considerations

### 5. Implementation Guidance
- Clearer step-by-step instructions
- Time estimates and complexity assessment
- Dependencies and prerequisites
- Testing methodology specific to manufacturing apps

## Expected Improvements from Console

The Anthropic Console should enhance this to:

1. **Add Systematic Research Steps**:
   - Analyze existing React components
   - Review API patterns and database schemas
   - Identify UI/UX patterns and accessibility requirements
   - Research manufacturing-specific best practices

2. **Include Domain Context**:
   - Manufacturing environment constraints
   - Technician user personas and workflows
   - Industrial reliability requirements
   - Voice operation and accessibility needs

3. **Enhance Technical Specificity**:
   - TypeScript patterns and type safety
   - Supabase RLS and authentication patterns
   - PDF processing and chat integration
   - Testing strategies for manufacturing applications

4. **Improve Output Format**:
   - Structured sections with clear headers
   - Actionable implementation steps
   - Realistic time estimates
   - Risk assessment and mitigation strategies

## Next Steps

1. **Copy this basic prompt** into Anthropic Console
2. **Enable "thinking" mode** for better reasoning
3. **Generate improved version** and compare
4. **Iterate and refine** based on output quality
5. **Test with real GembaFix features** to validate effectiveness

The goal is to create a meta-prompt that consistently produces high-quality, actionable GitHub issues from simple feature ideas - the foundation of compounding engineering.
