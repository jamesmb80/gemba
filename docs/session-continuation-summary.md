CCI: Implement collaborative troubleshooting between technicians
CCI: Add equipment performance analytics and trend analysis
```

### Option 2: Start Implementation
**Pick any existing GitHub issue and begin development:**
- Issue #7: PDF Search Filters (80 hours, high impact)
- Issue #2: Checklist System (15 hours, quick win)
- Issue #6: Bookmarking System (24 hours, user experience)

### Option 3: Advance to Phase 4
**Add advanced quality gates and automation:**
- Prompt consistency testing and improvement
- Automated implementation workflows  
- Advanced tool integration and optimization

## üí° Quick CCI Usage Reminder

**Simple Usage:**
```
CCI: [describe any feature idea or bug]
```

**What Happens Automatically:**
1. Analyzes your GembaFix codebase for integration patterns
2. Applies manufacturing domain expertise
3. Researches technical best practices
4. Creates comprehensive GitHub issue (2000+ words)
5. Includes implementation plan, testing strategy, success criteria
6. Optimized for industrial environment and voice operation

**Recent Example:**
- **Input**: "Add search filters to PDF viewer for better navigation"  
- **Output**: Issue #7 with 80-hour implementation plan, 5 development phases, manufacturing focus

## üöÄ Tomorrow's Starting Prompt

**Copy and paste this when you return:**

```
I'm continuing from yesterday's session where we completed Phase 3 of the AI development workflow implementation. We now have the CCI (Claude Code Intelligence) command fully operational - when I type "CCI: [feature idea]", you automatically run the Master Research Prompt v2.0, analyze the GembaFix codebase, apply manufacturing domain expertise, and create comprehensive GitHub issues.

Current status:
- ‚úÖ 7 GitHub issues created (including Issue #7 via CCI workflow)  
- ‚úÖ CCI workflow tested and operational
- ‚úÖ GitHub CLI authenticated and ready
- ‚úÖ Manufacturing review framework validated
- ‚úÖ All Phase 1-3 objectives completed

Ready to continue with either:
1. More CCI feature research commands
2. Begin implementing existing GitHub issues  
3. Advance to Phase 4 (Quality Gates & Implementation Automation)

What would you like to focus on today?
```
