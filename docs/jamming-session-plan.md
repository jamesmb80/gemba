1. **Open 5-6 Claude Code terminals** (or whatever system can handle)
2. **Prepare master research prompt** in each terminal
3. **Queue feature ideas** in order of priority/complexity
4. **Set 15-minute timer** for first batch

### Execution Waves

#### Wave 1: Simple Features (First 30 minutes)
Launch these simultaneously:
1. **Checklist System**: "Add checklist system for multi-step troubleshooting procedures"
2. **Bookmarking**: "Add bookmarking system for quick access to important manual content"  
3. **Smart Search**: "Create smart manual search that understands equipment variations"

**Expected Runtime**: 15-20 minutes each
**Complexity**: Low-Medium (UI focused, existing component extensions)

#### Wave 2: Workflow Features (Next 30 minutes)
Launch when Wave 1 completes:
4. **Troubleshooting Templates**: "Create templates for common troubleshooting workflows"
5. **Knowledge Sharing**: "Add knowledge sharing system for repair insights and tips"
6. **Session Handoff**: "Create seamless session handoff between mobile and desktop"

**Expected Runtime**: 20-25 minutes each  
**Complexity**: Medium (workflow integration, data modeling)

#### Wave 3: Advanced Systems (Final 30 minutes)
Launch for most complex features:
7. **Expert Escalation**: "Add escalation system to connect with experts remotely"
8. **Safety Integration**: "Add mandatory safety checklist integration to troubleshooting flows"
9. **Supervisor Dashboard**: "Create supervisor dashboard for team coordination and support"
10. **Offline Sync**: "Implement robust offline-first data synchronization system"

**Expected Runtime**: 25-30 minutes each
**Complexity**: High (real-time systems, complex integrations)

## üìä Session Management

### Monitoring Progress
- **Track completion times** for each feature research
- **Note any AI issues** or incomplete outputs
- **Queue backup features** if any fail to complete
- **Document interesting patterns** in AI research quality

### Resource Management
- **CPU/Memory monitoring**: Watch system performance with multiple instances
- **Network usage**: Multiple Claude Code sessions may impact bandwidth
- **Terminal organization**: Clear labeling for each feature being researched
- **Output collection**: Systematic saving of completed research

### Quality Checkpoints
- **Quick scan outputs** as they complete (don't do full review yet)
- **Flag obviously incomplete** or poor quality results
- **Note which features** produce best research quality
- **Track manufacturing context** coverage in outputs

---

## üîç Batch Review Phase (15 minutes)

### Review Strategy
After all research completes, batch review using our manufacturing checklist:

#### Triage Approach (3 minutes total)
1. **Quick scan all outputs** (30 seconds each)
2. **Identify obvious winners** (comprehensive, clear manufacturing value)
3. **Flag obvious rejects** (incomplete, poor understanding, wrong direction)
4. **Mark middle tier** for detailed review

#### Priority Review (12 minutes)
1. **Review obvious winners first** (2-3 minutes each)
2. **Quick review middle tier** (1-2 minutes each)  
3. **Document reject reasons** (30 seconds each)

### Expected Outcomes
Based on Kora team experience:
- **80%+ approval rate**: 8-9 features ready for implementation
- **15% refine rate**: 1-2 features need specific improvements
- **<5% reject rate**: 0-1 features fundamentally wrong direction

---

## üìà Success Metrics

### Quantity Targets
- **Features Researched**: 8-10 complete specifications
- **Time Efficiency**: <2.5 hours total (including review)
- **Parallel Benefit**: 8-10x improvement vs sequential research

### Quality Targets  
- **Manufacturing Focus**: 100% of features address real industrial needs
- **Implementation Ready**: 80%+ approved without refinement needed
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: All features include technical, UX, and business analysis

2. **Document lessons learned** for future jamming sessions
3. **Plan implementation priorities** based on feature value and complexity
4. **Schedule next jamming session** to maintain momentum

## üöÄ Expected Transformation

### Before Jamming Session
- **Traditional Planning**: 4-7 hours per feature = 40-70 hours for 10 features
- **Sequential Process**: One feature researched at a time
- **Inconsistent Quality**: Manual research varies by person and energy level
- **Limited Scope**: Only 1-2 features planned per week typically

### After Jamming Session  
- **AI-Assisted Planning**: 2.5 hours total for 10 features
- **Parallel Process**: Multiple features researched simultaneously
- **Consistent Quality**: Systematic methodology applied to every feature
- **Comprehensive Backlog**: 2+ weeks of implementation work planned

### Productivity Impact
- **25x Speed Improvement**: 2.5 hours vs 40-70 hours traditional
- **Higher Quality**: Systematic coverage vs ad-hoc manual research
- **Better Manufacturing Fit**: Domain expertise embedded in every feature
- **Team Scaling**: Process works regardless of who runs it

---

## üîß Contingency Plans

### If System Performance Issues
- **Reduce parallel instances** to 3-4 instead of 5-6
- **Stagger launch times** by 2-3 minutes between features
- **Use simpler features** if complex ones cause resource issues

### If AI Output Quality Issues
- **Refine prompts** based on early results
- **Add more context** to feature descriptions that produce poor results
- **Focus on higher-value features** if time becomes constrained

### If Review Takes Too Long
- **Prioritize high-value features** for detailed review
- **Accept some refinement work** rather than perfect first-pass
- **Schedule follow-up session** for completing reviews if needed

This jamming session plan transforms GembaFix feature development from weeks of sequential planning to hours of parallel AI-assisted research, following the proven Kora team approach.
