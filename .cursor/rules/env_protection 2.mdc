# Environment File Protection

**Never edit environment files directly** - these contain sensitive configuration that should only be modified by the user.

## Protected Files
- `.env` files (`.env`, `.env.local`, `.env.production`, etc.)
- `mcp.json` files containing API keys and sensitive configuration

## What NOT to do
- ❌ **Never use `edit_file` on `.env*` files**
- ❌ **Never overwrite environment files with placeholders**
- ❌ **Never create environment files with real API keys**
- ❌ **Never modify `mcp.json` files directly**

## What TO do instead
- ✅ **Ask the user to add their own API keys**
- ✅ **Provide instructions for manual configuration**
- ✅ **Show example structure without real values**
- ✅ **Use `echo` commands to show what the user should add**

## Example Safe Approach
```bash
# ✅ DO: Show user what to add
echo "Please add your API key to .env.local:"
echo "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-actual-key-here"

# ❌ DON'T: Edit the file directly
# edit_file .env.local ...
```

## When Environment Setup is Needed
1. **Provide clear instructions** for the user to add their keys
2. **Show the exact format** they should use
3. **Remind them to restart the server** after changes
4. **Never include real API keys** in any code or commands

## Emergency Recovery
If environment files are accidentally modified:
1. **Immediately inform the user**
2. **Help them restore from backup** if available
3. **Provide clear steps** to recreate the file
4. **Apologize and explain** what went wrong
