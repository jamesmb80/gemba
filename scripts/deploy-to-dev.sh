# Deployment Summary - Stories 1.1 & 1.2

**Date**: $(date)
**Environment**: Development
**Status**: âœ… Ready for deployment

## Completed Steps:
- âœ… Dependencies installed
- âœ… Code quality checks passed
- âœ… Unit tests passed
- âœ… Build completed successfully
- âœ… Feature flags verified (disabled by default)
- âœ… Integration tests passed

## Next Steps:
1. Deploy built application to hosting platform
2. Run database migrations
3. Run smoke tests
4. Enable feature flags gradually

## Database Migrations to Run:
- 20250116_pgvector_setup.sql (Vector database infrastructure)

## Feature Flags to Enable (in order):
1. VECTOR_SEARCH_ENABLED (first)
2. CHUNKING_ENABLED (after vector search is verified)

## Monitoring:
- Watch for errors in application logs
- Monitor database performance
- Check API response times
- Verify vector search functionality
