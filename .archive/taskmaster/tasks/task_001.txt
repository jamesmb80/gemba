# Task ID: 1
# Title: Codebase Cleanup and Organization for Production Readiness
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Remove all debugging scripts, duplicate files, development artifacts, and reorganize the GembaFix project structure to ensure a clean, professional codebase ready for production deployment.
# Details:
Conduct a thorough audit of the entire GembaFix codebase to identify and remove all debugging scripts, temporary files, duplicate files, and any development-only artifacts. Refactor the project structure to follow industry best practices for maintainability and scalability, such as grouping related modules, enforcing consistent naming conventions, and ensuring clear separation of concerns. Update documentation to reflect the new structure. Utilize static code analysis tools to detect code smells, duplication, and potential security vulnerabilities. Ensure all changes are tracked in version control, and coordinate with team members to avoid conflicts during the cleanup process. Prioritize readability, maintainability, and adherence to clean code principles throughout the process[1][3].

# Test Strategy:
1. Review the repository to confirm removal of all debugging scripts, duplicate files, and development artifacts. 2. Verify the new project structure matches documented standards and is logically organized. 3. Run static code analysis tools to ensure no code smells, duplications, or security vulnerabilities remain. 4. Ensure all tests pass and the application builds and runs successfully in a production environment. 5. Confirm that documentation accurately reflects the reorganized structure and usage guidelines. 6. Solicit peer review to validate codebase cleanliness and organization.

### Details:
Check for misplaced or outdated test files and document their current locations.

## 7. Relocate Test Files [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.6
### Description: Move test files to the appropriate directories (e.g., `__tests__` or `tests`) to standardize structure.
### Details:
Use `git mv` to preserve file history during relocation.

## 8. Remove Console Statements [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Search for and remove all `console.log`, `console.error`, and similar statements from the codebase.
### Details:
Use code search tools or linters to identify and eliminate debugging output.

## 9. Clean Up Unused Directories [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Identify and remove any unused or obsolete directories from the project.
### Details:
Review the directory structure and delete folders that are no longer needed.

## 10. Update .gitignore [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.3, 1.5, 1.7, 1.9
### Description: Review and update the `.gitignore` file to ensure all unnecessary files and directories are excluded from version control.
### Details:
Add patterns for build artifacts, logs, and other non-essential files.

## 11. Review Directory Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.9
### Description: Examine the overall directory structure for consistency and adherence to best practices.
