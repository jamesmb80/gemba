			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Project Repository and Initial Structure",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the setup process into subtasks: initializing the Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS, configuring strict TypeScript settings, establishing the directory structure, integrating Supabase configuration, installing dependencies, and setting up ESLint/Prettier.",
			"reasoning": "This task is foundational but follows well-documented steps for initializing a Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS, configuring directories, and integrating Supabase. While it involves multiple tools, each step is straightforward and supported by official documentation[1][2][3]."

		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Supabase Authentication and User Management",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks: configure Supabase Auth, implement email/password login, set up registration, create user profile tables, add password reset, implement Next.js middleware for route protection, and configure RLS and audit logging.",
			"reasoning": "Integrating authentication, user management, and security policies with Supabase and Next.js middleware involves multiple moving parts, including database schema changes, middleware logic, and security configuration. Each component requires careful implementation and testing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Build Machine-Centric Navigation and Dashboard",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into subtasks: design machine grid UI, implement dashboard layout, add status indicators and last activity, integrate Chat/Manual/History actions, build breadcrumb navigation, and implement search/filter functionality.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires building a responsive UI with dynamic data, state management, and multiple interactive features. While not highly complex, it covers several UI and UX aspects that benefit from modularization."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Develop AI Conversational Troubleshooting Interface",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks: build chat UI, integrate AI API, implement confidence indicators, persist conversations, handle loading/error states, ensure machine context, and test session persistence.",
			"reasoning": "This task combines real-time UI, AI integration, session management, and persistence. It requires careful handling of asynchronous operations, error states, and context awareness, making it one of the more complex features."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Document Management System",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks: integrate Supabase Storage, implement PDF upload, link documents to machines, index content for AI, build document viewer, manage metadata, implement RLS, and test AI search integration.",
			"reasoning": "This involves file storage, database relationships, content indexing, secure access, and building a custom viewer. Each area is non-trivial and requires robust error handling and integration."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Build Automatic Session Logging and History Management",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into subtasks: implement session logging, set up real-time updates, detect session completion, store summaries, enable full-text search, build session detail view, and add export functionality.",
			"reasoning": "Capturing, updating, and searching session data in real time, with secure access and export features, involves backend and frontend coordination and careful database design."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Performance Monitoring Dashboard",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks: design dashboard UI, implement Supabase views/aggregations, track AI confidence/user engagement, add real-time updates, implement trend analysis, and test performance.",
			"reasoning": "While analytics dashboards are common, integrating real-time data, trend analysis, and performance tracking adds moderate complexity, especially with custom metrics."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Enhance UI/UX and Accessibility",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks: implement touch-friendly components, add high-contrast and accessible UI, ensure ARIA/keyboard navigation, integrate icons and visual hierarchy, and test on various devices.",
			"reasoning": "UI/UX and accessibility improvements are essential but can be modularized by component and device type. The work is well-scoped but requires attention to detail."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Quality Assurance and Testing Framework",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into subtasks: set up component testing, write integration tests, test PDF/AI features, perform load testing, conduct security testing, validate accessibility, and ensure cross-browser compatibility.",
			"reasoning": "Establishing a comprehensive testing framework across multiple domains (unit, integration, performance, security, accessibility) is complex and requires coordination across the codebase."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Deploy and Monitor Application",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks: configure staging/production environments, implement feature flags, set up monitoring/logging, automate backups, establish disaster recovery, manage environment variables, and handle database migrations.",
			"reasoning": "Deployment and monitoring involve environment setup, automation, monitoring, and recovery planning. Each area is critical for production readiness and requires careful, stepwise implementation."
